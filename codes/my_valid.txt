Similar stuff is happening where I am, and I also get anxious hearing about it.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Affirmation and Reassurance"}, {"text": "And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid?

I am much more used to it at this time.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March.

So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety.

They're putting others at risk.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Affirmation and Reassurance"}, {"text": "Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "yeah exactly.
